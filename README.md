# DataStorytelling

After finnishing book Python for Data Analysis it's time to test acquired knowledge and skills.

I want to do this project because I want to see where I stand when come to data analysis skills which includes following skills:
- Data mining
- Data wrangling
- Data manipulation
- Data processing
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization

I am going to use python with Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?fromMenu).
I will try to use as much as possible self explanatory code.
Source code is going to be in .py file and with graphs and charts I make in projects will be saved as images.

I find data that seem interesting to me, and with which I can make storytelling (make samo elementary statistic, try to find some interesting facts, and visualize as much as possible of these questions I came up).
